# üí´ About Me:
Highly skilled Software Engineer with a strong background in Machine Learning, Web Development, and Network Service Orchestration. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as Flask, React, Node.js, and Angular. I have experience in developing API connectors and plugins for Camunda BPM modeler, as well as optimizing workflows through network service orchestration and containerization.<br><br>I am also an experienced researcher and have led teams to build neural-based models for detecting sarcasm, humor, and hate speech in tweets. My research work has been published in top conferences such as KDD and ECIR. Additionally, I have developed a recommendation model using deep neural networks and BERT, resulting in a web framework based on Flask and Elastic Search for user querying.<br><br>As a master's student at Northeastern University, I have learned from industry leaders and experienced professors as well as implemented projects using Python, Machine Learning, SQL, NoSQL, SpringBoot, Apache Kafka, and ReactJS. The common denominating factor while facing all these different tech stacks was my intellectual curiosity at problem-solving and having an end-user-defined approach during development.<br><br><br>üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Cloud Computing and NLU<br>üë®‚Äçüíª All of my projects are available at https://manjotmb20.github.io/<br>üì´ Contact me for jobs, chats, advice, and collaborations on manjotmb20@gmail.com
